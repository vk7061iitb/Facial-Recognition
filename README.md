# Facial Recognition and Emotion Analysis in Video Streams
## Overview
The Facial Recognition and Emotion Analysis in Video Streams project aims to develop a real-time system capable of detecting faces, recognizing individuals, and analyzing their emotional expressions within video streams. By leveraging advanced techniques such as face detection algorithms, facial recognition models, and deep learning-based emotion analysis, this system will identify individuals in the video feed and classify their emotions into predefined categories such as happiness, sadness, or anger. The integration of efficient real-time processing methods and visualization techniques will enable the system to provide immediate feedback on the identities and emotional states of individuals within the video stream.

## Features
- Face Detection: Real-time detection of faces in video streams using state-of-the-art algorithms.
- Facial Recognition: Identification of individuals based on facial features.
- Emotion Analysis: Classification of emotional expressions into predefined categories such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.
- Real-time Processing: Efficient processing techniques to ensure minimal latency and immediate feedback.
- Visualization: Graphical representation of detected faces and their corresponding emotional states.

## Technologies Used
- Python: The primary programming language for development.
- OpenCV: Library for real-time computer vision.
